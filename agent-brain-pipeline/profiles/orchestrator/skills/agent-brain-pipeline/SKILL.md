# Agent Brain Pipeline

Use the deterministic Pipeline API through the bundled client. Never print `AGENT_BRAIN_API_TOKEN` or other secrets.

Set the client path once per terminal command:

```bash
CLIENT="${HERMES_HOME:-$HOME/.hermes}/skills/agent-brain-pipeline/scripts/brain_api.py"
```

## Commands

```bash
python3 "$CLIENT" ingest https://github.com/OWNER/REPO
python3 "$CLIENT" ingest https://gitlab.com/GROUP/REPO --ref main
python3 "$CLIENT" status INGEST-XXXXXXXXXXXX
python3 "$CLIENT" list --limit 20
python3 "$CLIENT" report INGEST-XXXXXXXXXXXX acquire
python3 "$CLIENT" report INGEST-XXXXXXXXXXXX structure
python3 "$CLIENT" report INGEST-XXXXXXXXXXXX semantics
python3 "$CLIENT" report INGEST-XXXXXXXXXXXX audit
python3 "$CLIENT" retry INGEST-XXXXXXXXXXXX
python3 "$CLIENT" search "how are profiles loaded?" --mode hybrid
```

## Required workflow

When the user provides a GitHub or GitLab repository URL:

1. Run `brain-api ingest <URL>` exactly once.
2. Return the run ID immediately and explain that the durable pipeline worker owns execution.
3. Use `brain-api status <RUN_ID>` when the user asks for progress.
4. Do not clone or analyze the repository in the Hermes container.

For knowledge questions, use hybrid search by default. Use exact search only for literal identifiers, configuration keys, or error messages.

## Safety and data boundaries

- The Pipeline API validates GitHub/GitLab URLs.
- The durable worker runs all deterministic stages and survives chat-session termination.
- SQLite is the source of truth; the Obsidian Kanban mirrors it.
- Profiles supervise and interpret. They do not replace Git, Python, CodeGraphContext, Codebase-Memory, or checksums.
